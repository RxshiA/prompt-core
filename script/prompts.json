Rising global temperatures, caused primarily by increased greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, are leading to melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events. Scientists warn that without immediate action to reduce carbon emissions, we may face irreversible damage to our planet's ecosystems.\"\n\n*Summary*: \"Climate change, driven by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, is causing rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events. Scientists emphasize the urgent need for immediate carbon emission reductions to prevent irreversible ecosystem damage.\"\n\n**Example 2:**\n*Original*: \"The study examined 500 participants over six months to determine the effectiveness of a new meditation app. Researchers found that users who practiced meditation for 15 minutes daily showed a 40% reduction in stress levels compared to the control group. Additionally, participants reported improved sleep quality and increased job satisfaction.\"\n\n*Summary*: \"A six-month study of 500 participants found that daily 15-minute meditation app usage reduced stress levels by 40% compared to controls, while also improving sleep quality and job satisfaction.\"\n\n---\n\n**TEXT TO SUMMARIZE:**\n{text}\n\n**SUMMARY:**"

    "prompt": "# TASK: KEY POINT EXTRACTION\n\nYou are an expert information analyst skilled at identifying and extracting the most critical information from complex texts. Your goal is to distill content into its essential components while maintaining logical hierarchy and clarity.\n\n## INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. **Analyze** the text thoroughly to understand its structure and main themes\n2. **Identify** the most important concepts, arguments, facts, and conclusions\n3. **Prioritize** information based on relevance and impact\n4. **Organize** points in logical order (chronological, importance, or thematic)\n5. **Ensure** each point is self-contained and actionable\n\n## KEY POINT REQUIREMENTS:\n- **Format**: Clear bullet points with descriptive content\n- **Length**: 3-8 key points (depending on text complexity)\n- **Style**: Concise but complete thoughts (10-25 words per point)\n- **Content**: Focus on actionable insights, main arguments, and critical facts\n- **Hierarchy**: Most important points first, supporting details follow\n\n## EXTRACTION CRITERIA:\nâœ“ **Main Arguments**: Core thesis and supporting claims\nâœ“ **Critical Facts**: Important data, statistics, or findings\nâœ“ **Key Processes**: Steps, methods, or procedures mentioned\nâœ“ **Outcomes/Results**: Conclusions, recommendations, or implications\nâœ“ **Notable Details**: Unique insights or surprising information\n\n## EXAMPLES:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*Original*: \"A recent study by Harvard Medical School found that regular exercise significantly impacts mental health. The research, conducted over 18 months with 2,000 participants, showed that individuals who exercised for 30 minutes daily experienced a 45% reduction in anxiety symptoms. The study also revealed that group exercises were more effective than solo workouts, with participants showing improved social connections and motivation levels. Researchers recommend incorporating both cardiovascular and strength training for optimal results.\"\n\n*Key Points*:\nâ€¢ Harvard study demonstrates strong link between regular exercise and improved mental health\nâ€¢ Daily 30-minute exercise routine reduces anxiety symptoms by 45% over 18 months\nâ€¢ Group exercises prove more effective than solo workouts for mental health benefits\nâ€¢ Social connections and motivation levels improve significantly with group exercise participation\nâ€¢ Optimal results require combination of cardiovascular exercise and strength training\n\n**Example 2:**\n*Original*: \"The company's quarterly earnings report reveals mixed results for Q3 2024. Revenue increased by 12% compared to the same period last year, reaching $2.4 billion. However, profit margins decreased due to rising operational costs and supply chain disruptions.

    "prompt": "# TASK: TEXT CLASSIFICATION\n\nYou are an expert content analyst with deep expertise in distinguishing between different types of textual content. Your role is to accurately categorize text based on its primary characteristics, intent, and informational value.\n\n## CLASSIFICATION CATEGORIES:\n\n### ðŸ“° **NEWS**\n- **Definition**: Factual reporting of recent events, developments, or occurrences\n- **Characteristics**: Timely information, journalistic style, event-focused, often includes dates/locations\n- **Indicators**: \"reported,\" \"announced,\" \"occurred,\" \"according to sources\"\n\n### ðŸ“Š **FACT**\n- **Definition**: Objective, verifiable information or established knowledge\n- **Characteristics**: Data-driven, measurable, scientifically backed, universally accepted\n- **Indicators**: Statistics, research findings, historical data, scientific principles\n\n### ðŸ’­ **OPINION**\n- **Definition**: Subjective viewpoints, personal beliefs, or interpretative judgments\n- **Characteristics**: Evaluative language, personal perspective, argumentation, value judgments\n- **Indicators**: \"I believe,\" \"should,\" \"better/worse,\" \"in my view,\" subjective adjectives\n\n## CLASSIFICATION PROCESS:\n1. **Read** the text completely and identify the primary purpose\n2. **Analyze** the language style, tone, and content structure\n3. **Look for** key indicators and linguistic markers from each category\n4. **Determine** the dominant characteristic (texts may have mixed elements)\n5. **Provide** classification with detailed reasoning\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT:\n**Classification:** [CATEGORY]\n**Confidence Level:** [High/Medium/Low]\n**Reasoning:** [2-3 sentences explaining your decision with specific textual evidence]\n\n## EXAMPLES:\n\n**Example 1:**\n*Text*: \"The Federal Reserve announced yesterday that it will raise interest rates by 0.25% effective immediately. The decision was made following a unanimous vote by the Federal Open Market Committee. This marks the third rate increase this year, bringing the federal funds rate to 5.5%.\"\n\n**Classification:** NEWS\n**Confidence Level:** High\n**Reasoning:** This text reports a recent, specific event (Federal Reserve announcement) with factual details including timing (\"yesterday\"), specific data (0.25% increase), and official sources (Federal Open Market Committee). The objective, journalistic style and time-sensitive nature clearly indicate news reporting.\n\n**Example 2:**\n*Text*: \"Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure. This physical property occurs because the vapor pressure of water equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure at this temperature, causing rapid vaporization throughout the liquid.\"\n\n**Classification:** FACT\n**Confidence Level:** High\n**Reasoning:** This text presents objectively verifiable scientific information about water's boiling point with precise measurements and scientific explanation. The content describes universal physical laws that can be experimentally verified, making it factual rather than opinion or news.\n\n**Example 3:**\n*Text*: \"I believe the new smartphone design is absolutely terrible. The camera placement looks awkward, and the color options are uninspiring. Apple should have stuck with their previous design approach, which was far more elegant and user-friendly.\"\n\n**Classification:** OPINION\n**Confidence Level:** High\n**Reasoning:** This text contains clear subjective language (\"I believe,\" \"terrible,\" \"should have\") and evaluative judgments about design aesthetics. The author expresses personal preferences and recommendations without objective evidence, making this clearly an opinion piece.\n\n**Example 4:**\n*Text*: \"Recent studies suggest that remote work may increase productivity by up to 15%. However, critics argue that this data doesn't account for long-term collaboration challenges. While some companies report positive outcomes, others worry about maintaining company culture in distributed teams.\"\n\n**Classification:** OPINION\n**Confidence Level:** Medium\n**Reasoning:** Although this text mentions studies and data, it primarily presents interpretative analysis and conflicting viewpoints rather than reporting concrete facts or recent events. The hedging language (\"may,\" \"suggest,\" \"critics argue\") and balanced presentation of different perspectives indicate this is analytical opinion rather than straight factual reporting.\n\n---\n\n**TEXT TO CLASSIFY:**\n{text}\n\n**CLASSIFICATION:**"
